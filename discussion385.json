        "body": "Hi Dr. Cranmer (or others),\r\n\r\nFor the PySR custom loss function (loss = \"loss(x,y, w[optional]) = \") we specify in the model, right now it seems \"x\" is the data input while \"y\" is the analytic value found by PySR, and w are any weights the data has (which is optional), though please correct me if I misunderstood the variables (and this could potentially solve my problem).  However, if I'm using PySR to model something very specific (i.e. Poisson likelihood) and have a custom loss function that also depends on other variables ( data x = x(r), where I also want to include r in the loss function), is there a way to do this?  https://astroautomata.com/PySR/options/#loss has some nice examples of loss functions, but not introducing any other variables than the data \"x\" and fit value \"y\".\r\nThank you.",

The evaluation used to create the predictions happens automatically using your passed data (a matrix of shape (examples,features)) and the current expression. Let me know if I misinterpreted your question though!\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nMiles\r\n",

              "body": "Oh wait I think I misunderstood. Do you need weights *and* the radius r? If you only need the radius in the loss function, you can just treat it like `loss(prediction, target, r)=â€¦`, and pass `weights=r`. But if you need both, will be trickier. Let me know.",
