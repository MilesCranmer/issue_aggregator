        "body": "Hello,\r\nI am comparing the performance of different symbolic regression approaches based on the number of evaluated expressions (Max 100,000). Could someone help me to understand which parameters should I set (and maybe which parameters are the most important) to constrain the approach to max 100.000 evaluations? \r\nI presume I must change parameters: niterations, populations, population_size, and ncyclesperiteration, but I am not sure how\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nSebastian",

So taking the default parameters will be quite suboptimal for evaluation efficiency. Sadly Iâ€™m not sure which parameters are most relevant for such an performance metric.",
