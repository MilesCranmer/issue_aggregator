Maybe if it is just a single FFT in a fixed position of the expression it wouldn't be so bad to add.\r\n\r\nThe way this will eventually be added (for very flexible expressions) is by allowing non-scalar equations. You can see at the bottom of the README on https://github.com/SymbolicML/DynamicExpressions.jl/, the backbone of SymbolicRegression.jl can already handle these sorts of things. It's just it needs to be set up for the rest of the code. ",
