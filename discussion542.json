        "body": "Thanks for creating this amazing package!\r\n\r\nFollowing #540 (and your recent Linkedin post), I was wondering if PySR can be used to search the space of possible equivalent circuit models given impedance-frequency measurements.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, I'm not trying to abuse your kindness in responding to such broad questions and even going above and beyond to provide a fully working prototype! (as you've kindly done in #540) I just want to know if PySR is the right tool for such problems, and possibly some high level pointers on where to start.\r\n\r\nThanks once again!",

If you can work with that then there is probably a way to write a loss function for it. For other types of inputs; SymbolicRegression.jl will need to be extended (help always appreciated!)",
