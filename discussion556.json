        "body": "Hello, and thank you for your work. I've been exploring some operators for sequence data recently, such as calculating the mean of sequence data. However, I noticed that PySR operates on individual data pairs (x1, x2, x3, ...) - (y1) rather than matrices or sequences. Could you advise on how I might configure or modify PySR to achieve the functionality I'm looking for? Thank you in advance for your response.\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\nI want to use `shift(1)`, when I input series (x1, x2, ... , xn), I can get  ( x2, x3, ..., xn, Nan)\r\nor\r\nuse `mean(x)`, when I input series (x1, x2, ... , xn) , I can get `avg(x)`, (x1+x2+...+xn)/n\r\n",
