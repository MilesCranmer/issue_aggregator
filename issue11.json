        "body": "I saw this bug this morning and it is now solved in `0.3.18`.\r\n\r\nThis bug is when PySR tries to calculate the age of an equation. It seems that the offset I am using for \"birthdate\" of an equation, equal to `1e3*(time() - 1.6e9)`, and put into an Integer variable (so there is millisecond precision between equations), has actually now maxed out 32-bit integers. I have changed the precision to 64-bit and this issue is fixed.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for this bug; please update your binaries when you use PySR next, with:\r\n```\r\npip install --upgrade pysr\r\n```",
