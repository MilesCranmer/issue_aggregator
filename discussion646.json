        "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the great work! I was wondering if there is a way to get the loss/score value associated with a known ground truth equation. For example i ran search using PySr however i found that it didn't find the correct equation, so i wanted to see the score value given to the ground truth equation that i have access to. This might be useful as i would want to know if the search couldn't find a equation with higher score or my complexity definition were bad which resulted in lower score for the ground truth equation.
