        "body": "Just a minor thing I noticed in my output that might want to be updated.\r\n\r\nWith the renaming of `ncyclesperiteration` to `ncycles_per_iteration`, the error message for high head worker occupation should probably be updated, as it still references `ncyclesperiteration`. Here is the warning I got in my run (with `ncycles_per_iteration` provided to `PySRRegressor`)\r\n\r\n\"Head worker occupation: 22.1%. This is high, and will prevent efficient resource usage. Increase `ncyclesperiteration` to reduce load on head worker.\"",
