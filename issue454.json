              "body": "Hi @guoaiBB,\r\n\r\nThe backend would have to some changes before it would support CUDA natively.\r\n\r\nI think basically it would need to be able to store symbolic expressions as some CUDA arrays in a new `Node{T}`-like type that subtypes `AbstractNode`: https://github.com/SymbolicML/DynamicExpressions.jl/blob/master/src/Equation.jl. It might be a lot of work FYI.\r\n\r\nBut, if you're just using CUDA for array evaluation, then it shouldn't be so bad. It might already work (on the Julia side of things). Take a look at https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",

Could you please give me some advice?\r\nIn addition, I would like to ask whether pysr can perform regression on\r\npartial differential operators, such as data simulated by cfd that solves\r\nns equations.\r\nThank you very much again\r\n\r\nMiles Cranmer ***@***.***> 于2023年11月12日周日 22:32写道：\r\n\r\n> Closed #454 <https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/issues/454> as\r\n> completed.\r\n>\r\n> —\r\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\r\n> <https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/issues/454#event-10934653418>, or\r\n> unsubscribe\r\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/BDVHEOUYHE4BC3IKHSLP6YLYEDMWVAVCNFSM6AAAAAA6ZDP2E2VHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV45UABCJFZXG5LFIV3GK3TUJZXXI2LGNFRWC5DJN5XDWMJQHEZTINRVGM2DCOA>\r\n> .\r\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID:\r\n> ***@***.***>\r\n>\r\n",

Generally I try to keep one topic per issue/discussion so it's easier for people to find if they search it.\r\n\r\nFor this question in particular, it's good if you could initially check the tuning advice page (https://astroautomata.com/PySR/tuning/) as well as the forums (https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions). If you can't find an answer there then feel free to post a new discussion for help.\r\n\r\n(300k rows is too large for PySR; you generally only need 5k max)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",
