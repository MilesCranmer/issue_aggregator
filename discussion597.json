But I would actually use more populations, and maybe 2 iterations per run so that migration happens.\r\n\r\nAnd then when I finally finish adding TensorBoard, that would be even easier: https://github.com/MilesCranmer/SymbolicRegression.jl/pull/277\r\n\r\nAlso see progress on a UI in https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/pull/589",
