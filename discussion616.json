I could not find any such Option in the EquationSearch.\r\n\r\nP.S.: And maybe it would also be possible to suppress printing out the results in each iteration.",

              "body": "You can do warm starts by passing the `saved_state` option to `equation_search`. Make sure to specify `return_state=true` so that `equation_search` actually returns the entire state the first time.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```julia\r\n\r\nsaved_state = equation_search(X, y; options=options, return_state=true)\r\n\r\n# Continue where it left off:\r\nsaved_state = equation_search(X, y; options=options, return_state=true, saved_state=saved_state)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever I might recommend using the `MLJ` interface which does this automatically. The second time you run `fit!(mach)`, it will propagate all expressions forward. (And will recompute the losses based on whatever the current dataset is).\r\n\r\nAlso, in case you were also asking about this, the most relevant other threads:\r\n- https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/418\r\n- https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/443\r\n\r\nOther threads that are relevant:\r\n- https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/557\r\n- https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/465\r\n- https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/401\r\n- https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/380\r\n- https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/issues/339\r\n- https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/417\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> P.S.: And maybe it would also be possible to suppress printing out the results in each iteration.\r\n\r\nYou can set this with `verbosity=0`.
