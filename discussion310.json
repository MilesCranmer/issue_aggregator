        "body": "I see that the progress bar can be turned off by setting progress=False. However, sometimes it is useful to look at the progress, while at the same time piping the results to another process. It looks like `SymbolicRegression.jl` is using an older version of `ProgressBars.jl`. \r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that default behaviour of `ProgressBars.jl` should be to print to stderr - [cloud-oak/ProgressBars.jl/pull/47](https://github.com/cloud-oak/ProgressBars.jl/pull/47) -, and `ProgressBars.jl` has been updated to behave that way [cloud-oak/ProgressBars.jl](https://github.com/cloud-oak/ProgressBars.jl). Is there an easy way of making `SymbolicRegression.jl` compatible with updated `ProgressBars.jl`?",
