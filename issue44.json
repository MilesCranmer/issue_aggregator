        "body": "Hi, \r\nI used the algorithm its unique and fine, but I have a problem,\r\nI.e I have some data, **including 1000 row, and 4 columns**, it has **3 inputs (x1,x2,x3)** and one **output (y)** when I run the algorithm it makes an equation like: **y=10*x1+2*x3** , (it just  includes x1 and x3)\r\nThe problem is that the result equation don't use **x2** as input, including best equation and all other generated equations. or the equation just contains **x1 and x2, but x3** not exist in equation or something similar...\r\nAlthough I need to an equation than contains **all inputs** (x1,x2,x3) \r\n**How can I force the algorithm to to make an equation that uses all inputs including x1,x2,x3?**\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n",

              "body": "Hi @danial1995,\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is already searching for equations using all inputs. The ones it returns to you are the equations satisfying the following.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7593028/118408786-09556980-b655-11eb-91b9-94f7f1833a9a.png)\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't give you equations with x2, that means none of the equations with x2 satisfy that constraint. i.e., they are **overly complex**. Does this make sense?  There is no current way of including such a \"prior\" on the equations to artificially lower the complexity if all features are included.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",
