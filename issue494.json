        "body": "### Feature Request\n\nHi！When I want to find some expressions from my data, I want his form to be specific. For example, I hope that the equation form obtained by pysr is C1 * x1 + ( C2 * x2 / F ), where F is the term to be found, C1 and C2 are constants to be found. This is equivalent to the form of a constrained expression tree, that is, adding a priori. Is it possible for today 's pysr to implement this function ?\r\nThanks！",

An easier way to do this is being discussed here: https://github.com/MilesCranmer/SymbolicRegression.jl/issues/193. (Help is always appreciated!)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",
