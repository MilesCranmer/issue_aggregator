              "body": "Thanks for raising this @marknovak! I looked into this and it is not an issue for general variable names; this is actually very subtle edge case which happens when you call one variable `N`. It is great you found it because I am sure `N` would be a common variable name, I had simply never tested it.\r\n\r\nIn general, `variable_names` work fine and are unit-tested. For example, if you specify `variable_names=[\"N1\", \"P\"]`, your code will work fine as is.\r\n\r\nThe issue is specifically due to calling one of the variables `N`. Apparently, this is due to the presence of a function with the same name `N` within SymPy (i.e., `from sympy import N`). I never import such a function from SymPy explicitly, but it seems like SymPy's own `lambdify` function, which turns the equation into a function, has internally imported this function!\r\n\r\nWill look into solving this. For now I might just add an error when the user specifies a variable name as `N` to be more clear about why this won't work. What do you think?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",
