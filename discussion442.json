        "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've just started using the PySR tool. Here's my challenge: I'm working with a dataset that consists of 79 features and a binary label (1 or 0).  This is a simple binary classification problem. I'm interested in exploring whether PySR can help me extract a mathematical expression from this dataset. I've tried some of the provided examples, but I haven't been able to use all 79 features/variables (or less) in the final mathematical expression. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance",

Be sure to read the tuning page for general tips: https://astroautomata.com/PySR/tuning/\r\n\r\n79 features is quite a lot. To use all of them you’ll have to use at least `maxsize=160`, but probably twice that much to use them effectively. I’ve never gone that high so I’m not sure how it will work.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",
