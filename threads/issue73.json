        "body": "Hi, thank you for providing us with a free symbolic regression library.\r\n\r\nSince I am new to this and I haven't fully understood everything yet. I would like to save my all results (after 12 hours of computation) from the output of pysr(). I've tried using pickle, shelve, dill and scipy.io but I can't get them to work. I keep getting different types of errors including this one below:\r\n\r\n>AttributeError: module '__main__' has no attribute 'inv'\r\n>AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'inv' on <module '__main__'>\r\n>PicklingError: Can't pickle inv: attribute lookup inv on __main__ failed\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you please advise me on what I should do to save the results so that I can come back and explore them later?\r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\nFor reference this is my script that was based on the examples:\r\n```\r\n# Learn equations\r\n  equation = pysr(\r\n      X,\r\n      y[:,ii],\r\n      binary_operators=[\"plus\", \"mult\"],\r\n      unary_operators=[\r\n          \"cos\",\r\n          \"sin\",  # Pre-defined library of operators (see https://pysr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/operators/)\r\n          \"inv(x) = 1/x\",\r\n      ],\r\n      loss=\"loss(x, y) = abs(x - y)\",  # Custom loss function\r\n      julia_project=\"../SymbolicRegression.jl\",\r\n  )  # Define your own operator! (Julia syntax)\r\n```",

              "body": "Hi @jstan15,\r\n\r\nSorry you are having trouble saving it. It should save the raw equations automatically to a .csv file in the current directory - do you see those? You can load them back in by calling `pysr.get_hof` with the location of that file.\r\n\r\nTo save the `equations` object that gets outputted, since you are defining a custom operator `inv(x) = 1/x`, you should add:\r\n```\r\nextra_sympy_mappings={\"inv\": lambda x: 1/x}\r\n```\r\nas an argument to either `pysr` or `get_hof` when you re-load the saved files. This defines the `inv` function for SymPy so it can correctly map it into sympy (and I think the pickling will work correctly then. ",

I'm not sure whether there are any downsides to using it, because I'm happy with the results so far.\r\n\r\nI'll try out your suggested method if I find anything wrong with cloudpickle.\r\n\r\nThank you once again.",
