I think it's worth it to have a small section on the docs about this, and what it means to have precompilation disabled. \r\n\r\nI think this section should replicate the contents of https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/plugins/python-build/README.md#building-with---enable-shared when it makes the recommendation that a shared library should be used instead.\r\n",
