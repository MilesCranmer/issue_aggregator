        "body": "Hi,\r\nI am wondering if anyone has tried to find an analytical approximate solution for a PDE using PySR. I mean, it seems feasible to apply a similar methodology to PINNs for PySR; specifically, in each iteration in PySR, the error of each equation proposed by PySR is computed through the sum of errors associated with the PDE, BC, and IC. I think this approach can be called Physics-Informed PySR. I am curious, have you known/come across any study about Physics-Informed PySR?\r\nAny idea/viewpoint is much appreciated,\r\nThanks",

(My hope is that Enzyme.jl will eventually give us this for free). A temporary workaround would be to use finite difference approximation for second-order.\r\n\r\nAlso check out: https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/299 https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/414 https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/447 https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/548.",
