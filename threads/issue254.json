Here is where the equations are printed to a file: https://github.com/MilesCranmer/SymbolicRegression.jl/blob/de0e51c89ae1a88cfc5a616a9d101b7a4d331dcb/src/SymbolicRegression.jl#L755-L766\r\n\r\nyou could probably add some code to append to a file over time, so that you can plot it, either live or at the end of training.",
