But at the end of the day it still requires one to run some Python code (see examples here: https://astroautomata.com/PySR/examples/).\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is some scikit-learn graphical user interface that already exists? Surely it would be popular. Since PySR is scikit-learn compatible it can probably just plug in.",
