        "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen I install the Rosetta version of Julia (not compiled natively to M1/ARM CPUs), I see this error after running `pysr.install()`:\r\n```python\r\nOSError: dlopen(/Applications/Julia-1.7.app/Contents/Resources/julia/lib/libjulia.1.7.dylib, 0x000A): tried: '/Applications/Julia-1.7.app/Contents/Resources/julia/lib/libjulia.1.7.dylib' (mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have 'x86_64', need 'arm64e'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Version (please complete the following information):**\r\n- OS: macOS 12.3.1, with Apple M1 Pro\r\n- Version: v0.9.0-1\r\n- Does the bug appear with the latest version of PySR? Yes\r\n",
