If you have some time available I could walk you through adding it. I can try myself but have a list of other features I’m working on so it will take a bit longer before I can work on it.\r\n\r\nNote that you can restart from where the previous search left off when you use the `warm_start` parameter and call `fit` twice. So I think this feature could exploit that same functionality, and basically pass the prior knowledge as existing equations/population members.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles\r\n",
