I tried to save as pickle by dumping \r\n```\r\nwith open('sr_model.pk', 'wb') as sr_model_file:\r\n    pickle.dump(sr_model, sr_model_file)\r\n```\r\nbut the following message was thrown:\r\n```\r\n[PicklingError: Can't pickle <function _lambdifygenerated at 0x7fd3ec06aee0>: attribute lookup _lambdifygenerated on __main__ failed]()\r\n```\r\n",

              "body": "Good question. I have never tried this, but note that PySR saves the equations to a csv file during the search. In the PySRRegressor model, this is set by `equation_file` (or is chosen automatically by the model).\r\n\r\nSo what you could do is get the equation file (`sr_model.equation_file`), then create a new PySRRegressor with the same settings, then run `sr_model.get_hof()`. This should load the equations from the csv file.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this works!",
