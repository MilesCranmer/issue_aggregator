        "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you for a great library. \r\n\r\nI'm having some issues when working with TemplateExpresssionSpec, and it could very well be a fault on my end... If I create a model with a TemplateExpression, fit and save it, and then try and load it (with `from_file`) in a different script, I cannot do any model predictions. I just get the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: Failed to evaluate the expression. If you are using a custom operator, make sure to define it in `extra_sympy_mappings`, e.g., `model.set_params(extra_sympy_mappings={'inv': lambda x: 1/x})`, where `lambda x: 1/x` is a valid SymPy function defining the operator. You can then run `model.refresh()` to re-load the expressions.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't use any custom operators in my TemplateEpxressionSpec, but maybe I still need to add some mappings to make the loading work?\r\n\r\nGrateful for any help!",
