        "body": "Hello Miles! Ⅰ am trying to apply your PySR to some biological dataset and wish to find some interesting results (something like compact ODE/SDE). But Ⅰ am kind of new to Julia, and when Ⅰ try to run the example, this bug jumps: \"PySR could not start Julia. Make sure Julia is installed and on your $PATH\". Ⅰ looked for some solution (add Julia path to the current workspace?) but Ⅰ still can't solve this problem, would you mind giving a solution? Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n**Ⅰ am trying to run on Mac, and the Julia version is 1.6 ('/Applications/Julia-1.6.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia'). **\r\n\r\nAnd also Ⅰ am curious that if PySR will be robust when data is noisy.  \r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\n",
