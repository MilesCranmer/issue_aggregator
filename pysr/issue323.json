You can find it here: https://github.com/MilesCranmer/pysr_paper and the arXiv here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01582. \r\n\r\nI consider this paper to be a \"v1,\" based on an older version of the codebase. I would like to write additional papers in the future describing major updates, and I plan to invite any significant open-source contributors to be co-authors!",
