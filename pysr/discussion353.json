        "body": "How can I add and evaluate function to the objective ? \n\nEssentially, I want to also search for functions for polynomials in your example (_https://astroautomata.com/PySR/examples/#9-custom-objectives_). Something like this `f(P(X)) / g(Q(X))`, where `f = P(X) ** y` or something else. \n\nI tried to reserve first l and r nodes for these functions and use the rest for polynomials:\n```\n    tree.degree != 2 && return L(Inf)\n   \n    attraction_func = tree.l\n    repultion_func= tree.r\n    \n    attraction_func != 2 && return L(Inf)\n    repulsion_func != 2 && return L(Inf)\n   \n    attraction = attraction_func.l\n    repulsion = repultion_func.l\n```\n\nbut it gives `inf` loss and only complexity of 1",
