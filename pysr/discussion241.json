You can manually select based on your own metric. `predict`, `sympy`, `jax`, etc., all have an `index` parameter. Simply pass the row of the equation you want to use (you can compute this from `model.equations_`, which is the dataframe holding the equations). If `index` is `None` (default), then the `model_selection` strategy is used. ",
