For each cycle say \"1\", we have behavior of the system i.e. current, voltage etc.\r\nI have used SR independently for each cycle and I am able to get decent accuracy (target = capacity).\r\nIs it possible to make it a function of cycle number as well?\r\nHow can I parse this type of data to PySR?\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",
