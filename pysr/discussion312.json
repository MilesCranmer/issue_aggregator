        "body": "Hi Miles,\r\n\r\nHope all's good! I would love to test PySR despite my pretty poor skills in Python/Julia (I work much more on R but I should definitely change that). I was a Eureqa user and I really love the interface/tool. I also got pretty cool results with Eureqa that were confirmed later with new data.\r\nI would like to test PySR with my dataset (taxa abundance and gene frequency) to predict toxicity. I am trying to follow the PySR doc with Docker but I am not sure how to define the predictive var and the response var. Is there any tutorial (for beginners) that you know of?  \r\nI can see how to set up the model and the search space. Not sure if there is a convergence or any search parameters to tell the model to stop searching (a bit what there was with Eureqa and convergence)?\r\nIs there a way to select (after the search) the simplest model based on AIC for example?\r\n\r\nSorry if these are very naive questions!\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\n\r\nNico",
