        "body": "### Feature Request\n\nGood morning everyone, \r\n\r\nI am new to PySR, so apologies if the questions I place are naiive.\r\nI was wondering if there is any way to have an automatic \"training and testing\" split, and for training I mean the value for fitting, while for testing unseen data on which the loss can be calculated. \r\n\r\nI am trying to implement this feature for my project, and I see that `model.predict()` evaluates the input based on the equation chosen by `model_selection`. Is there any way of evaluating the expression also on other candidate functions?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!",
