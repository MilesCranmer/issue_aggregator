        "body": "### Feature Request\n\nRather than making the user define custom `extra_sympy_mappings`, we could potentially take advantage of [SymPy.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/SymPy.jl) and automatically generate the sympy operators.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, and this would be more work, we could look at transferring the expressions directly from SymbolicRegression.jl, rather than using a .csv file as a medium.",
