        "body": "Hi,\r\nI am trying to use PySR to get expression for potential energy surface of molecules. My data is pairwise distance matrix and I want to perform summation operation along particular axis i.e. $\\Sigma_j r_{ij}$ where $r_{ij}$ is my pairwise distance matrix. I am new to PySR and can't figure out how to implement $\\Sigma_j$ operator. Any suggestions is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks",
