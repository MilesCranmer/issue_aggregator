The `from_file` method is taking many minutes without saying anything other than `attempting to load model from...`. Is there something that I can do to speed it up? The folder has both the pickle and the `hall_of_fame.csv`. \r\nBest,\r\nM",

I've refactored my logic so that I only use \"^\" operators. It's sometimes suboptimal as it's difficult to numerically approximate 2, 1/2, 3, 1/3 etc but it's been giving me less headaches!\r\n\r\nI might close this discussion as it's a user problem, not a `pysr` shortcoming.",
