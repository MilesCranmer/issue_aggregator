        "body": "Hi, thanks for the great package!\n\nWe’d like to define a custom power operator in PySR such that the exponent is always constrained to lie between 0 and 1. For example, we want expressions like x^a, where a ∈ [0, 1].\n\nIs there a recommended way to implement such a constraint?\n\nThanks!",
