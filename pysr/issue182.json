As well as any loss function that can be written as a sum over per-element losses, like `loss=\"myloss(x, y) = abs(x - y)\"` - so long as it is non-negative.\r\n\r\nTo add a more complex loss like a correlation-based loss, you can tweak this function (in Julia - but it's quite similar to Python): https://github.com/MilesCranmer/SymbolicRegression.jl/blob/7b4fecf9e136eb7b3acf29d0669e00e772efff56/src/LossFunctions.jl#L45-L49 to compare `prediction` with `dataset.y`. Both of these are Julia vectors. \r\n\r\nThen, give your path to the local copy of SymbolicRegression.jl to the `julia_project` parameter in `PySRRegressor`. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",
