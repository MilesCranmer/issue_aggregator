        "body": "Rather than requiring a user to set up `extra_sympy_mappings` whenever they define a custom operator, I think the expressions should be evaluated directly in Julia, without needing to convert them. This shouldn't require too many tweaks.\r\n\r\nThe one downside is it would be harder to restore a model from the saved `.csv` file.",
