        "body": "Hello everyone, I have a modeling scenario where I want to constrain the symbolic expression to a fixed formula structure like this:\r\n\r\n$$\r\ny(X) = \\frac{(1 + f(X)) \\cdot g(X)}{1 + f(X) + g(X)}\r\n$$\r\n\r\nwith the constraint that both the numerator and denominator must share the same f(X) and g(X) functions. Although my input data is X and the target is y, what I actually want is to discover the possible expressions of f(X) and g(X) that fit into a predefined structure. Can PySR enforce that the same f(X) and g(X) appear exactly in both the numerator and denominator? This kind of structure arises from physical constraints (like transmission-line theory), and it would be very helpful to control this behavior.\r\nThanks in advance for any insights!",
