              "body": "Great question; I should add a temporary file option. Note generally you can set the filename of this csv file to whatever you like with the `equation_file` argument (overwrites by default). Here are some notes on this behaviour:\r\n\r\n- I completely de-couple Python and Julia. Their only communication is via writing files to disk. This is because I found that PyJulia made distributed compute difficult to set up (and perhaps impossible for multi-node), so instead I just have Python basically meta-program a SymbolicRegression.jl program and run Julia on it. (also much easier to sort out `PATH` issues this way).\r\n- Because of this, the Python actually requires the hall of fame csv file to read back the best equations from Julia.\r\n- For all temporary files other than the equations file, I write to a temp directory that is deleted at the end of training (can turn this off with `delete_tempfiles=False`). This is made system independent with the `tempfile` module.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the hall of fame file, I use the current directory by default, and append the datetime so there is a new file for each run. But one can manually set the location with eg `equation_file=\"equations.csv\"`. This will overwrite whatever file is there. You could use Sacred on that filename, maybe?\r\n\r\nSo that's one option. The other option, which I don't have yet, is to make an optional flag to just put the equations file into the same temporary directory so it gets deleted after training.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",
