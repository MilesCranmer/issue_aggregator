        "body": "I was trying to follow the example code that uses dimensional constraints on the website - [Astro Automata](https://astroautomata.com/PySR/examples/#10-dimensional-constraints) - but it seems to break down when I keep the 'X_units' and 'y_units' part in the model.fit part - \r\n```\r\nmodel.fit(\r\n    X,\r\n    y,\r\n    X_units=[\"Constants.M_sun\", \"kg\", \"Constants.R_earth\"],\r\n    y_units=[\"kg * m / s^2\"]\r\n)\r\n```\r\nIt does seem to work when I comment them out and SR does give me the $\\frac{Mm}{r^2}$ relation but I'm having trouble constraining it. Not sure what I'm doing wrong or if I'm missing something.",
