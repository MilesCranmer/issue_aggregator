        "body": "Hi,\n\nI'm wondering if there's a way to constrain the constants generated in the equations to be **real only**, when the input and output are complex.\n\nFor example, in the code below, the input `X` is real but cast as complex (`0im`), and the output `y` is complex. I'd like to ensure that any constants generated in the regression (i.e., at the leaves) are real numbers. It's acceptable if they appear in the form `a + b*i`, but I want to enforce that `b = 0`.\n\n```julia\nusing SymbolicRegression\n\nn = 100\nX = reshape(range(0, 1, n), 1, n) .+ 0im\ny = @. X + X^2 * im\n\noptions = Options(\n    binary_operators=[+, *],\n    unary_operators=[],\n    populations=20,\n    verbosity=1,\n    should_simplify=true\n)\n\nhall_of_fame = equation_search(\n    X, y, niterations=40, options=options,\n    parallelism=:serial\n)\n```\n\nThank you for your support",
