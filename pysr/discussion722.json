        "body": "Lets said I have a dataset which contains N features data in T days.  My X is a matrix with dimension (T, N) , and Y is a vector with length T.   There are some basic time-series functions below:\r\n\r\n> ma( X,  d ):       d is a random generated constant number. Calculating moving average in the past d days of each feature n in X.    X[t, n] = mean( X[t-d+1:t, n] )\r\n\r\n> delay( X, d ):    d is a random generated constant number. Replacing X with the past d day value in each feature n.    X[t, n] = X[t-d+1, n]\r\n\r\n> argmax(  X,  d): d is a random generated constant number. Taking the largest number in the past d day of each feature n.    X[t, n] =  max( X[t-d+1:t, n] )\r\n\r\nI would like to put those functions above into Symbolic Regression model training and input as custom operators. \r\nIs that possible to achieve that? and how? Give a short example please. Thank you.",
