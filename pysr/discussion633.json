        "body": "Hi,\r\nI am wondering if we can tell pysr that include specific expressions in the inital population. E.g. assume : I know that three expressions y=x1**2+1, y=x**1.5+2, and y=exp(x1/10)/5 could kinda be close to the final solution, and I am interested that pysr includes these specific epxressions in the initial population. Is there any built-in feature in pysr to address such a request? \r\n\r\nAny advice is much appreciated.  ",
