In short, I want to provide the function $s(r) = re^{-r}$ as my only unary operator to find the solution of the form $f(r_{1},r_{2}) = c_{0}r_{1}e^{-\\alpha_{0}r_1} + c_{1}r_{2}e^{-\\alpha_{1}r_{2}}$, where $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are the data's features. However, the program predominantly explores solutions of the form $f(r_{1},r_{2}) = (r_{1} \\times r_{2})e^{-\\alpha_{1}r_{1} \\times + r_{2} + c_{0} + c_{1}}$. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nW. N.",

For example, `constraints={\"sto\": 3}` would mean that the operator `sto(r) = r*exp(-r)` can have at most a complexity of 3 in its argument, meaning something like `sto(a * r)` or simpler would be allowed.\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",
