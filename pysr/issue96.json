        "body": "readthedocs has been frustrating to build docs on - right now it's completely broken and not updating, and there isn't even an error message so I have no idea how to debug it. I also don't like how I have to check another website instead of reading the \"Actions\" tab.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I want to switch to a GitHub-action based docs builder on github-pages, just like for SymbolicRegression.jl. This allows me to have much more control over the docs page as well, and I can actually even integrate it within SymbolicRegression.jl as they will both be under the same domain.",
