While total loss seems fine, if one looks at each system individually the fit would be much worse in comparison to the result from only 2 terms ( if we compare two identical systems). \r\n\r\nIt seems that multi objective optimization( pareto optimization ) is the solution.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to use something like that? if not, will it be implemented in the near future?",

Unsure when or if I will make it available from PySR (since I think such flexibility would be incompatible with scikit-learn) but hopefully this will happen eventually.",
