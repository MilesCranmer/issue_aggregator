              "body": "Hello @MilesCranmer, \r\nI am working with PySR for my master´s thesis and noticed the new option of SymbolicRegression.jl to specify a logger. I am interested in this feature and therefore I wanted to ask, if it is already possible to use the logging option with PySR and if that is the case, how to implement it? I already tried to \"update\" the SymbolicRegression.jl File used in PySR manually to use the latest SymbolicRegression.jl version, like explained here (https://astroautomata.com/PySR/backend/), which did unfortunately not work.\r\nThank you very much for your support in advance!\r\nBest Regards",
