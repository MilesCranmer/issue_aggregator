        "body": "Hi, I am new to the SymbolicRegression. I have questions about how to control the output in hall of frame. \r\n\r\nQ1:  Is that possible to control the number of output in HOF?  (I tried to change the number of `topn` . It seems not working.) If yes, how? \r\n\r\nQ2:  It seems that each complexity has an unique result. Is that possible to give as many good results as possible , even that they have the same complexity.\r\n\r\nQ3: Sometimes, HOF will return formula like this  `y = constant_number`, which is not I want. I want formula which has at least one variable x. How could I fix this?\r\n\r\nQ4: I am training on a timeseries dataset and use custom loss function on Symbolic Regression Model. How could I input extra parameter (list of datetime) to my custom loss function? \r\n\r\nThank you. ",

              "body": "Q1-3 => It's a bit hard to do this because of things like the fact that $x + 1.0$ and $x + 1.000000001$ are technically different expressions with perhaps identical losses. And also things like $x / 2.0$ compared to $x * 0.5$. So the thing done right now is that only the first expression to hit a particular (loss, complexity) threshold is taken for each complexity from 1 to `maxsize`. I confess I'm not really sure how to do otherwise â€“ would you create some way of gauging diversity of expressions stored at each complexity. \r\n\r\nQ4 => can you convert them to floating point numbers for this?",
