        "body": "Hi, I hope you are doing well.\r\nI used PySR to solve the example on the PySR github page. However, each time I run the code, it upgrades Julia. I would appreciate it if you could tell me what the problem is. It is worth mentioning that I use a virtual environment for my code. You can see the results below.\r\n\r\nVersion (please include the following information):\r\n- OS: Ubuntu: 20.04.4\r\n- Julia version: 1.6.7\r\n- Python version: 3.9.12\r\n- PySR version: 0.10.1\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-09-04 18-59-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33625204/188320203-c7b54cc6-6501-4713-9a1b-71b303b02c16.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-09-04 18-58-18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33625204/188320210-202efc2a-88b5-4079-864d-6574bad2fd3a.png)\r\n\r\n",

              "body": "Hi @aminravanbakhsh,\r\nThis is normal behaviour. It is updating packages, not updating Julia itself. \r\n\r\nYou can disable this behaviour with `update=False`.\r\n\r\nAlso note that this only occurs the first time you run `fit(X, y)` in a Python process. Subsequent calls will not do this. If you quit and re-open Python, it will happen again. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMiles",
