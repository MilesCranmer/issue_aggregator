        "title": "[BUG]: Warm start from a loaded model not using the previous best equations",
        "body": "### What happened?\n\nHi, I was fitting a model that hanged. So I decided to load it to continue the run\n\n```python\nmodel = PySRRegressor.from_file(run_directory=PATH)\nmodel.warm_start = True\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, variable_names=feature_columns)\n```\n\nhowever, I noticed that it was not continuing from where it left of, but started a new run and rewrote the CSV file with new (and worse) equations. I then tinkered a bit to try to understand, and did this\n\n```python\nmodel = PySRRegressor.from_file(run_directory=PATH)\nmodel.warm_start = True\nold_run_id = model.run_id\nmodel.run_id = model.run_id+\"-2\"\nmodel.run_id_ = model.run_id_+\"-2\"\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, variable_names=feature_columns)\n```\n\nand it starts a new run, ignoring the previous hall of fame, but at least it doesn't re-write the previous run.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\n### Version\n\n1.3.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Package Manager\n\nOther (specify below)\n\n### Interface\n\nJupyter Notebook\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Extra Info\n\npackage manager: uv",
