        "body": "First thanks for your excellent open-sourced work. I am using pySR to find the underneath expression in control problem. Currently, I use a Reinforcement Learning algorithm DDPG to train a neural network to stabilize  Pendulum and keep it vertical. Now, I randomly generated states (Pendulum x, y in cartesian coordinates and angular velocity) and feed forward them to DDPG and got output, namely, actions. I use pySR to fit states and actions, but the result show that loss is high and score is low. \r\nBinary operator: + - * /\r\nUnary operator: cos sine\r\nI also use plot to visualize actions Truth and predictions by pySR, and it give me a plot below.  Can you give me some advice on how to improve the regression result?\r\n![output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d87cad6e-94e6-40df-a3f6-41c61cea7408)\r\n",
