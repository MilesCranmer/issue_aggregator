        "body": "This will be primarily tracked in the SymbolicRegression.jl repo: https://github.com/MilesCranmer/SymbolicRegression.jl/issues/89.\r\n\r\nI think the PySR frontend would need to use a map from variable name to differential operator, so that a user could pass a pandas array with column names, and specify the differential operators using the same names.\r\n\r\nThis could look like, for example: `unary_operators=[\"Dx(1)\", \"Dx(2)\"]` to specify differential operators with respect to `x1` and `x2`, respectively.",
