Let me know if this has already been solved, anyway, here is my question.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if it is possible to load a model previously obtained using the function \"PySRRegressor.from_file()\" not from a .pkl but from a .csv file ? I unfortunately got my job killed for an overload of memory, so I do not have a .pkl file from the which I could restart.\r\n\r\nIf not possible, is it possible to generate a pkl file from a csv file ?\r\n",

But note that the `pkl` file contains some of the settings, so if you are only passing the `.csv` file, you will have to pass some other settings.
