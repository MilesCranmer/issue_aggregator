        "body": "Hi, thank you for all your work! It is amazing!!! \r\n\r\nDoes PySR support multitask learning? Specifically, I have several datasets for different tasks and I would want to compute losses relative the datasets and aggregate them in some way. I have looked up documentation and it seems like the only way to do that is just combine all datasets into one matrix `X` and call `.fit` on it. But going this direction makes it impoossible to distinguish the datasets. Does anybody know any other way of approaching it?",

              "body": "Hi, thanks!\r\n\r\nIf you are ok with having fixed weightings, I would just make a custom loss function and sum up the different losses.\r\n\r\nI recommend using a TemplateExpressionSpec for this and just putting all the datasets into X; then you can call an expression multiple times with different features each time.\r\n",
