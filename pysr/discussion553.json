Here’s RMSE as an example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nloss_function = \"\"\"\r\nfunction f(tree, dataset::Dataset{T,L}, options) where {T,L}\r\n    ypred, completed = eval_tree_array(tree, dataset.X, options)\r\n    if !completed\r\n        return L(Inf)\r\n    end\r\n    y = dataset.y\r\n    return sqrt(sum(i -> (ypred[i] - y[i])^2, eachindex(y)))\r\nend\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nmodel = PySRRegressor(loss_function=loss_function)\r\n``` ",

              "body": "Now I really want to experiment with PySR. In the past I've used Eureqa and found it amazing. But more recently I've been using a home-grown optimizer for modeling time-series data. I discovered that a loss function built on a Dynamic Time Warping metric is very helpful to guard against over-fitting, see my blog post https://geoenergymath.com/2024/03/08/dynamic-time-warping.  Now, thinking back to how Eureqa often took a while to close in on a potential solution, a DTW metric as loss function may be very useful in an exploratory mode. It wouldn't be difficult to prototype as a custom loss function with a configurable window size.  See this 2024 paper as well: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10359.pdf\r\n",
