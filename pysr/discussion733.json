(I considered both options but there seemed to be too many gotchas if we actually took into account unit values)\r\n\r\nHowever we could definitely add nT to the units library, which is developed here: https://github.com/SymbolicML/DynamicQuantities.jl. My policy is to basically add a unit whenever someone requests it (rather than adding a bunch of units that nobody uses)",
