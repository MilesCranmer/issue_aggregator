        "body": "I had been struggling to get PySR working in most environments but was successful in running the Google Colab tutorial. I was hoping to migrate the functionality of the first block of code out of Google Colab into a python or .pytoml file in order to run PySR outside of the Google Colab environment. However I have been struggling understand what the block of code does to make PySR work.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n!echo \"Runtime started.\"\r\n\r\n%%shell\r\nset -e\r\n\r\n#---------------------------------------------------#\r\nJULIA_VERSION=\"1.7.2\"\r\nJULIA_NUM_THREADS=4\r\nexport JULIA_PKG_PRECOMPILE_AUTO=0\r\n#---------------------------------------------------#\r\n\r\nif [ -z `which julia` ]; then\r\n  # Install Julia\r\n  JULIA_VER=`cut -d '.' -f -2 <<< \"$JULIA_VERSION\"`\r\n  echo \"Installing Julia $JULIA_VERSION on the current Colab Runtime...\"\r\n  BASE_URL=\"https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64\"\r\n  URL=\"$BASE_URL/$JULIA_VER/julia-$JULIA_VERSION-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\"\r\n  wget -nv $URL -O /tmp/julia.tar.gz # -nv means \"not verbose\"\r\n  tar -x -f /tmp/julia.tar.gz -C /usr/local --strip-components 1\r\n  rm /tmp/julia.tar.gz\r\n\r\n  echo \"Installing PyCall.jl...\"\r\n  julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"PyCall\"); Pkg.build(\"PyCall\")'\r\n  julia -e 'println(\"Success\")'\r\n\r\nfi\r\n```\r\nDoing this Google Colab specific task was also necessary:\r\n\" Use fallback runtime.

Note that Google Colab runs in the cloud, rather than on your local machine â€“ so even if Julia is installed locally, it still needs to be installed on the colab VM.\r\n\r\n> Doing this Google Colab specific task was also necessary:\r\n> \" Use fallback runtime.

See https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/3385.
