        "body": "Hi I am new to Python and trying to install PySR through Jupyter\r\nSo I installed first Python3 though Anaconda, then downloaded Julia through Juliaup in my user directory\r\nC:\\Users\\Ralph\\.julia. \r\nThis generated a number of subdirectories with the following file included in the juliaup subdirectory :julia-1.10.1+0.x64.w64.mingw32 and pysr 0.16.9 in the environments subdirectory\r\n\r\nI then created a jupyter notebook file where I !pip installed numpy, pandas,sympy and matplotlib\r\nfollowed in a new cell by import pysr; pysr.install -m (install()) as mentioned in the pysr installation document\r\n\r\nI then ran the published test code in the Python default environment and got the following ERROR, furthermore the Kernel seemed to terminate also during the run\r\n\r\n#PYSR data simulation\r\nX = np.linspace(0, 10, 100).reshape(-1, 1)\r\ny = np.sin(X).ravel() + np.random.normal(0, 0.5, X.shape[0])\r\n\r\n# running symbolic regression and show equations\r\nmodel = PySRRegressor(niterations=100, binary_operators=[\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"])\r\nmodel.fit(X, y)\r\nprint(model)\r\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n\r\n    Cell In[5], line 2\r\n          1 # running symbolic regression and show equations\r\n    ----> 2 model = PySRRegressor(niterations=100, binary_operators=[\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"])\r\n          3 model.fit(X, y)\r\n          4 print(model)\r\n    \r\n\r\n    NameError: name 'PySRRegressor' is not defined\r\n\r\nCan someone point out if there was an error in my installation process ?Do I need to use  another way to install pySR, if yes which one exactly  in Jupyter ?\r\nI am running Jupyter in Windows10, \r\n\r\nWhat should the Windows PAth look like after Julia  installation ? to which directory or file should it exactly point to ? \r\nthis is my current Windows user PATH: C:\\Users\\Ralph\\.julia\\juliaup\\julia-1.10.1+0.x64.w64.mingw32\\bin\r\n\r\n",
