        "body": "Dear Miles\r\n\r\nI have a dataset of 2000 training points. I have set the number of iterations to 100, procs=8 / cpu.count() and multithreading=True. When I am looking at the CPU usage, I see all 8 of them are at 50-70% during PySr's training. Even if I saturate procs to 32, this issue still remains. What should I change here? \r\n\r\nAlthough I get the answer in less than 2 minutes even with these settings, I want to make use of all 8 CPUs.\r\n\r\nIf I run for a higher number of iterations=500 and populations=3*32 over a \"pbs\" cluster of procs=32, I see the same issue there. Only one CPU is getting used. The settings here were: procs=32, cluster_manager=\"pbs\"\r\n",

If that number is high, the head worker basically canâ€™t give out work quickly enough. \r\n\r\nTo improve this you should increase population size and/or ncyclesperiteration.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can use multiprocessing instead of multithreading by setting `multithreading=False`. I find sometimes that improves usage of cores for whatever reason.",

              "body": "What version of PBS are you using? I know that some people have run into issues on multi-node processing with PBS due to ClusterManagers.jl not yet supporting the latest qsub command line arguments. See https://github.com/JuliaParallel/ClusterManagers.jl/issues/179.\r\n\r\nSo your current options are to:\r\n1. Use single-node multiprocessing (`cluster_manager=None, multithreading=False, procs=32`).\r\n2. Use a slurm cluster manager, if available, to get working multi-node multiprocessing.\r\n3. Help us fix the issue on https://github.com/JuliaParallel/ClusterManagers.jl/issues/179. It's a bit hard for me to fix this myself since I don't have a PBS cluster I can test it on (all my institutes use slurm). So any help is much appreciated. ",
