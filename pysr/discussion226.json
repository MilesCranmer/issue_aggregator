        "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nPySR looks promising with some features like \"constraints\" and \"nested_constraints\", which Eureqa did not seem to be capable of.\r\n\r\nCurrently, to exclude the variable from an operator, e.g. \"pow\", we must play with complexity:\r\n```\r\n    complexity_of_variables = 2,\r\n    complexity_of_constants = 1,\r\n    constraints={\r\n        \"pow\": (-1, 1),\r\n    },\r\n```\r\nIn this way, no variable can appear in the y position of x^y. However, this also makes the constants appears too frequently in the results.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to exclude variable from an operator without affecting complexity? I believe it can be useful for implementing domain knowledge.\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n",

This can be done by modifying the backend as described on this page: https://astroautomata.com/PySR/backend/. You will want to edit the `check_constraints` function to perform this check. ",
