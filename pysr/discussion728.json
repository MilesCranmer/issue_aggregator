At the same time, the documentation for `nested_constraints` suggests that it is possible to apply `nested_constraints` also to binary operators.",

              "body": "The way to do it is `[(/) => [(/) => (0, 0)]]`. In other words, you need to provide a tuple of integers rather than a single integer. These integers correspond to the left and right argument. This is so that you can, e.g., set a different constraint for the base of `^` than the exponent.",
