For this project, I could easily live with two significant digits.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to reduce the precision of the coefficients and constants, and would it help the search process at all?\r\n\r\n",

              "body": "You can reduce the frequency of constant optimizations with `optimize_probability` or even turn it off altogether with `should_optimize_constants=False`. That will give you a decent speed up.\r\n\r\nYou can also play around with the `mutate_constant` parameter, which lets the evolutionary algorithm tweak the constants.\r\n\r\nThereâ€™s also the `precision` parameter, which you could try lowering to 16, although it probably depends on your CPU whether this actually gives a speed up (for me, it was actually slower).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",
