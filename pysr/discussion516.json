              "body": "Sorry, I missed this for some reason. The simplification should happen regularly but it is a separate step. You actually don't want to simplify *every* step because it can prevent certain expressions from being found which are one hop away. e.g., `unary_op(constant)` might become `unary_op(constant + x)`. But if you simplify beforehand it wouldn't be able to necessary get there.",
