        "body": "### Feature Request\n\nHi Miles @MilesCranmer\r\nThanks for developing the helpful tool! \r\nIn my model, the equation expression to be sought is relatively complex - the complexity is usually between 20-30, and I have around 10 independent variables, with a large amount of data. In this case, I would like to introduce an initial equation into the expression tree: start evolving from this expression, rather than generating a set of random initial expressions. Is it possible to implement this function in the current pysr framework?\r\nBy the way, my PySR version is 0.19.4 because for my reason, I have found that the older model parameters are more beneficial for my problem.",

You would write out the initial expression and then learn modifications to it. Especially with a lot of variables this is probably helpful for your problem to make things easier.",

The constraints of the equation form and the dimensional constraints are not compatible, and when both exist at the same time, an error will be reported :\r\n<img width=\"372\" alt=\"8a5b4a1b7ce1e61092ddcfabe5c5357\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92a77d5b-63df-450b-b191-d30608e38edc\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n2. When using tensorboard, the Model loading function will not be compatible (I am very sure that this error will occur after the TensorBoard function is used.) :\r\n<img width=\"713\" alt=\"08fea33b6ddb6d8733c60f28c7ecee4\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfd2fc5b-f1b9-4c64-914f-fb878776ff42\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n3. When I use the Model loading function to continue running the previous results, it seems to run from the initial hall _ of _ fame, rather than from the previous hall _ of _ fame (This problem seems to exist before version 1.0).\r\n<img width=\"628\" alt=\"9847ba8e93d9d8d526a6de36f85c7ff\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e22d849-1d45-494e-a838-bd9396d5a50d\" />\r\n\r\nHope to hear from you back soon. Thanks!",

The implementation would be quite complex. The assertion is there to make sure both features are not used.\r\n\r\nMaybe there could be a Python error for this though, to make it more obvious it’s intended?\r\n\r\n> When using tensorboard, the Model loading function will not be compatible (I am very sure that this error will occur after the TensorBoard function is used.)\r\n\r\nThanks, this looks like a bug. Can you please submit another issue with details about how you generated it?\r\n\r\n> When I use the Model loading function to continue running the previous results, it seems to run from the initial hall _ of _ fame, rather than from the previous hall _ of _ fame (This problem seems to exist before version 1.0).\r\n\r\nDo you have `warm_start=True`? Otherwise it will get reset\r\n",
