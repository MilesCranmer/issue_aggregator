        "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nOver the past few months, I've worked with AI tools like PySR and quantum eigenvalue solvers to pursue something long considered unreachable: deriving a self-adjoint operator whose spectrum aligns with the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function — a concept central to the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture.\r\n\r\nUsing symbolic regression, the AI discovered the following operator:\r\n\r\nH = -d²/dx² + x² + sin(7x)\r\n\r\nThis operator, when numerically evaluated, yields eigenvalues that align closely with the imaginary parts of the first 50 non-trivial zeros of the zeta function — with less than 5% deviation in several regimes.\r\n\r\n GitHub repo with full source and data:\r\n https://github.com/Mqhele-dot/zeta-operator\r\n\r\nChallenge to the Community:\r\nCan this operator be derived analytically from known zeta structures?\r\n\r\nIs the spectral alignment mathematically meaningful or coincidental?\r\n\r\nCan AI-assisted methods like PySR accelerate discovery in unresolved conjectures?\r\n\r\nWould love your insights, challenges, or criticisms. Even if this doesn't yet form a formal proof, it's an example of symbolic-AI meeting deep math problems head-on.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to feedback!",
