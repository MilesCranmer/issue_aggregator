For example, see the last part of the example colab notebook here: https://github.com/MilesCranmer/symbolic_deep_learning for a time series example.\r\n\r\nThe other way to solve this to create a custom loss function that incorporates your dataset structure. For example, you can learn recursive functions like https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/540#discussioncomment-8356138 which could be used for time series data, or unpack the data explicitly as in https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR/discussions/426#discussioncomment-7025901. \r\n\r\nVectors and matrices will soon be supported in the symbolic expressions themselves (see https://github.com/SymbolicML/DynamicExpressions.jl/pull/85 for progress) â€“ though the API for this isn't yet worked out. So for right now the above two options.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",
