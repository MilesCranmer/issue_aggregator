        "body": "### What happened?\n\nThere is a trivial bug in the README.md, a typo. \r\n\r\nWhen defining a `PySRRegressor`, at some point it says `denoising=True` when the correct syntax is simply  `denoise=True`. \n\n### Version\n\n0.16.5\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS\n\n### Package Manager\n\nNone\n\n### Interface\n\nJupyter Notebook\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nn/a.\n```\n\n\n### Extra Info\n\nIt seems that I can't push a local branch that fixes the typo to the remote, otherwise I would've made a PR (and PR-ing a fork for this issue seems like an overkill). \r\n\r\nThanks!",
