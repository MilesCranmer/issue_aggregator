        "body": "Hi! \r\nFirst off, congratulation on this awesome package!\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there is a way to use PySR to identify a generalized form of the equation ruling different traces. A simple example would be identifying the equation \"a*x+b\" from the following traces : y1 = 2*x1+3, y2= 3*x2+5, y3= -1*x3 + 4 etc.  \r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n",

But ideas appreciated.\r\n\r\nRight now you could hack it â€“ I think the easiest way to do something like this is to simply turn it into a single equation search (rather than 3), and pass the index of the equation (y1, y2, y3) as an additional feature. Then it could find something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ny = (2 > i) * 2 * x1 + (3 > i) * (i > 1) * 3 * x2 - (i > 2) * x3 + 2 + i\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich as you can see gives you all `y1` (i=1), `y2` (i=2), and `y3` (i=3) in a single expression. Furthermore it will try to find the minimal equation that fits all three at once.\r\n\r\n(You can pass `greater` as one of the operators)\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's a smarter way to do this though... Ideas appreciated!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiles",

              "body": "I don't know the intricacies of your code but what I understand is that you first \"evolve the operator tree\" (sorry if i don't use the right terms) and then fit the constants values to the data. if these are separate steps, the fitting procedure could be done separately on each traces and return an average goodness of fit for that \"operator tree\". You could then judge how successful the \"new evolved tree\" is and continue to the next \"evolution/mutation\".  That would ensure that the same \"operator tree\" is used for all traces.",
