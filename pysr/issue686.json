PySR should include an Apptainer definition file which researchers can use, or extend, to build PySR Apptainer containers.",

It works OK but I've had some issues with ClusterManagers.jl before in the past. Eventually I'd like to switch to using MPIClusterManagers.jl which relies on MPI.jl which is probably much more compatible across clusters. https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPIClusterManagers.jl",
