        "body": "Seems like SymPy now has a native PyTorch export: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/27760. I think it would reduce internal complexity if we depend on that rather than hand-rolling our own.\n\nThe one downside is that those exported modules are not trainable. But maybe that's actually better, depending on how people actually want to use the model? Would be a breaking change though.",
