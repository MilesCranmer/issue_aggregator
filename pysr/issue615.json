        "body": "### Feature Request\r\n\r\nI am currently trying to use Symbolic Regression as part of an optimization routine. \r\nNow, since I expect the result to be very often very similar from one optimization step to the next, I would like to be able to supply an initial guess or starting point to the Symbolic Regression in order to speed up things. \r\nIs that already possible ? I could not find any such Option in the EquationSearch.\r\n\r\nP.S.: And maybe it would also be possible to suppress printing out the results in each iteration.",
