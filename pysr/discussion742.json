        "body": "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI am new to PYSR. I've been tasked with analyzing a complex system where the variables are interdependent, meaning changes in one variable affect others in a coupled manner.\r\n\r\nMy question is: Can PYSR be used to derive a system of equations that accurately describes such a coupled relationship between variables?\r\n\r\nPYSR seems to be a powerful tool for symbolic regression, but as a first-time user, I'm unsure if it's capable of handling systems where multiple outputs depend on each other through a set of equations rather than just finding a single equation relating inputs to a single output.\r\n\r\nAny advice or pointers on how to get started with this would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help!",

For our research involving reaction and transport phenomena, the combinations of these coupled variables are actually limited. \r\n\r\nWould this information make it easier to apply PYSR, or perhaps suggest any specific strategies for using the software effectively in this scenario?\r\n\r\nThanks again for any insights you can offer.\r\n\r\nBest regards,",

At present, it is possible to try to fit one equation at a time. \r\n\r\nHas there been any work since the inception of this post in trying to either learn two or more equations (whether ODEs or not)? \r\nThanks in advance for any advice you may be able to give.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMijan",
