Perhaps there could be an automatic report generated with all relevant info, and all the user would have to do is click a link, and it would get sent to the core devs? (I am thinking it would be safer to have it sent to the core devs directly, rather than posted publicly, just in case the report accidentally includes tokens/passwords. We would then upload the redacted version to the issues page). ",
