However, this is not 100% satisfactory and I want to do more SR to improve on that. \r\n\r\nI do not have the pickle file or the hall_of_fame.csv as I run other regressions after the lucky one so I believe everything has been overwritten. I just have the symbolic expression. Is there a simple way to seed the population with that expression?",
