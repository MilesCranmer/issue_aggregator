        "body": "I have an application where I know that the data is generated by a multivariate polynomial (e.g. $a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot x_0 \\cdot x_0 + c \\cdot x_0 \\cdot x_1$) up to order $degree_{max}$ (2 in example). \r\nI want to restrict the pysr search space to not include polynomials with higher order than $degree_{max}$ (e.g. for $degree_{max} = 2$, an expression including the term $x_0 \\cdot x_0 \\cdot x_1$ should not be searched).\r\n\r\nRelevant pysr-settings:\r\n```\r\nbinary_operators=[\"+\", \"*\", \"-\"]\r\nunary_operators=[]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, I do not understand how to set correct `constraints `/ `nested_constraints `/ complexities to restrict the search space.\r\nMy idea was to restrict the usage of the `\"*\"` operator (note I am not using `\"^\"`) to only allow for at most max_degree factors (but a constant should be allowed). \r\n\r\nThank you for your help!",
