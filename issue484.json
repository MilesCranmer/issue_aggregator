I was looking through the Julia code yesterday and saw a function that seems to generate a random expression that has a parameter for the length of the expression, [here](https://github.com/MilesCranmer/SymbolicRegression.jl/blob/93b1b26296811e8a3713b509ec52cfe44634dc08/src/MutationFunctions.jl#L228C1-L238). Could this function in principle be used to generate fixed size expressions, or are they not valid (no rules for appending random ops)?\r\n\r\nSorry if the question is unwelcome ðŸ˜….",
