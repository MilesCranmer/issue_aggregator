        "body": "Hi. I have a single-layer feedforward neural network that was fitted on a dataset (created using known functions). I want to recover the generating functions from the outputs of the trained neural network (and not the output from the dataset). Is it possible to do so? If yes, are there any considerations/guidelines that might aid this search as opposed to if we were to use PySR directly on the dataset? Thanks!",
