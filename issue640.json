What I had in mind was the output equation mimicking a classification process, where the labels are scalar integers. That probably counter intuitive to the definition of regression, but I'm wondering if generating an equation that ultimately computes an integer is possible? Maybe naively a bunch of indicator functions of each variable? If so, would just using a custom loss function help?\r\n\r\n> Actually I guess you could get it working as a custom loss function: https://astroautomata.com/PySR/examples/#9-custom-objectives\r\n> \r\n> Maybe you could split a single tree into multiple expressions.
