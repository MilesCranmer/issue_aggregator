        "body": "Hi,\r\nFirst of all, I would like to say big thanks to the developers for developing this precious package. It is truly powerful; especially, for using multicores to expedite exploration search .\r\n \r\nI am going to use your package but my case is not conventional one. I have a particular loss function. Wondering if you could kindly give me ideas/solutions by which the loss function becomes a python code whose inputs are correlations, and then the loss corresponding to each correlation is calculated based on some criteria implemented in the python code.\r\n\r\nIf you could also share a snippet of code for the solution, that would be an unforgettable help. \r\n\r\nMany thanks for your time and consideration, \r\nCheers,\r\nAhmad",
