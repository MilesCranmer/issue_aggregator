I think you could do that like this:\r\n\r\n```julia\r\n# Create array to store whether feature was used:\r\nwas_feature_used = zeros(Bool, dataset.nfeatures)\r\n\r\n# Loop through nodes in tree:\r\nforeach(tree) do node\r\n    if node.degree == 0 && !(node.constant)\r\n        was_feature_used[node.feature] = true\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n\r\nnumber_features_used = sum(was_feature_used)\r\n```",
